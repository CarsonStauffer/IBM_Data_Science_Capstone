# IBM_Data_Science_Capstone

This is the final assignment in my IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, a crash course in data science techniques. 

I know there will be many people with the same assignment. If that is you, feel free to reference this work, use the same dataset, or follow this approach, but don't copy the assignment wholesale! You will only hurt yourself. I highly recommend doing the full analysis yourself as it was pretty fun and doesn't require any knowledge not learned in the rest of the course.

## Instructions

All the code is inside of the Jupyter Notebook "clustering_seattle_neighborhoods.ipynb". An interactive version of the notebook can be found on mybinder.org [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/CarsonStauffer/IBM_Data_Science_Capstone/f0ba508acc71c7495f3dc488eda8bceae21a9c53).

The other files in the repository include the relevant CSV files and images (mostly used in [this](https://www.linkedin.com/post/6771192736176582656/) article).
